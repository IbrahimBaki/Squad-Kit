**Plan once, execute cheap.** A 3-step SDD-style workflow CLI for AI-assisted coding: **raw story → good plan → implementation**. Your expensive model plans once. A cheap model executes many times. Squad-kit owns the folder conventions, the plan meta-prompt, and the agent slash-commands so the token cost goes where it pays off. Deeper product notes live on **[squad-kit.com](https://squad-kit.com)** and in [`docs/`](docs/philosophy.md).

- **Visual console** — `squad console` opens a local, dark-modern web UI for stories, plans, live planner runs, config, secrets, tracker, and doctor. Loopback-only, token-gated. v0.6.0 redesigned the console with a near-monochrome Vercel/Geist palette, a Cmd+K command palette, Linear-style chord shortcuts (`g s`, `g p`, `?`), a portal-rendered dialog system, and a density toggle. Full tour: [`docs/console.md`](docs/console.md).

![Squad console dashboard](docs/images/console/dashboard.png)

```
.squad/
├── stories/<feature>/<id>/  # intake + attachments (one per story)
└── plans/<feature>/         # NN-story-<id>.md (one per executable plan)
```

## What's new in 0.6.0

- **Console redesign** — Geist-style flat dark UI, Cmd+K command palette, global keyboard shortcuts, portal dialogs, density toggle. Same CLI and `.squad/` on disk; no migration. See [`docs/console.md`](docs/console.md).

## What's new in 0.5.0

- **`squad console`** — local web UI on `127.0.0.1:4571` for the whole workflow (dashboard with run charts, stories, plans + diff, live Generate SSE, config/secrets editors, tracker search/import, graphical doctor). See [`docs/console.md`](docs/console.md).
- **Run history** — last 20 planner runs under `.squad/runs/` power dashboard charts; **recent projects** list in `~/.squad/recent-projects.json` for quick handoff between repos.
- **`pnpm size:guard`** — publish tarball must stay under 2.5 MB unpacked.

## What's new in 0.4.0

- **`squad new-plan --api` limits UX.** When a budget or cap stops the planner, the CLI asks before more API spend. Stop saves a `*.partial.md` with a clear status flag; exit code **2** when the run did not finish cleanly.
- **`planner.maxOutputTokens`** in merged config (default **16384** tokens per model round).
- **Shorter plan filenames** — new plans use the story folder id (`NN-story-<id-slug>.md`), not a long title slug; the overview table still shows the title.
- **Richer intakes** when `squad new-story` fetches Jira / Azure work items (more fields wired into the template).
- **`squad list`** reads `<!-- squad-kit: … -->` metadata from the first matching line near the top of a plan file, not only line 1.

## What's new in 0.3.0

- **Prompt caching** across Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google — ~70% fewer billed input tokens on
  a typical planning run, and Anthropic Tier 1 ITPM pressure roughly 5× lower.

## What's new in 0.2.0

- **Direct planner.** `squad new-plan --api` runs Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google from your terminal and writes the plan file. Demand-driven context keeps tokens bounded.
- **Tracker auto-fetch.** `squad new-story --id <ID>` pulls title, description, labels, and attachments (≤ 10 MB each) from Jira Cloud or Azure DevOps Services.
- **Secrets split.** API tokens live in `.squad/secrets.yaml` (git-ignored, `0600` on POSIX). `.squad/config.yaml` never holds secrets; the loader rejects secret-shaped keys.
- **Interactive-first UX.** Missing input prompts in a TTY; `-y` / `--yes` or `CI=1` opts out and fails fast.
- **`squad doctor`.** Full read-only health check; `--fix` for non-destructive repairs, `--json` for scripting.
- **`squad migrate`.** One-shot 0.1.x → 0.2.0 structural migrations (delete legacy `.squad/prompts/`, permissions, config normalisation). Destructive; use `--dry-run` first.
- **`squad upgrade`.** Safe npm-backed self-update (`--check` to verify only).
- **`squad config`.** `show`, `set planner` / `set tracker`, `unset …`, `remove-credential …` — edit config and secrets without hand-editing YAML.
- **`squad rm`.** `rm story` / `rm plan` / `rm feature` with `--dry-run`, `--trash`, and cascading overview updates.
- **Bundled prompts.** `generate-plan.md`, `intake.md`, and `story-skeleton.md` ship inside the npm package; upgrade the CLI to update them.

Full list in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## Upgrading from 0.1.x

Existing squad-kit users should run two commands, once per repo:

```bash
pnpm add -g squad-kit@0.2.0       # or: npm install -g squad-kit@0.2.0 — or: squad upgrade
cd your-project && squad migrate
```

`squad migrate` deletes the now-unused `.squad/prompts/` directory, appends the managed `.gitignore` block, tightens `.squad/secrets.yaml` permissions to `0600`, and normalises `.squad/config.yaml`. It is idempotent but destructive — run it with `--dry-run` first if you forked the prompt files.

Full upgrade walkthrough, including what-if scenarios and how to recover customised prompts: [migration guide (repo)](docs/migrating-from-0.1.md) · [migration guide (site)](https://squad-kit.com/docs/migrating-from-0.1).

## Install

```bash
npm install -g squad-kit@0.2.0
# or
pnpm add -g squad-kit@0.2.0
```

Requires Node 18+.

## Workflows

This fork supports two parallel workflows. Choose based on whether you already have a tracker story.

### Local-first (daily — no tracker required)

Go from raw description to reviewable plan in one step:

```
/squad-quick "in stats, In Probation, In Notice Period and Employment Type are not reflected with filters"
```

`/squad-quick` analyzes the codebase, creates a local intake under `.squad/stories/<feature>/q-<feature>/`, and generates the plan. Review the plan, then implement:

```
/squad-implement .squad/plans/<feature>/NN-story-<slug>.md
```

After implementing, optionally document the work on Azure DevOps:

```
/squad-log --kind Bug --parent 6432 q-stats-filter
```

`/squad-log` reads the existing intake + plan (no re-analysis) and creates the work item, then appends a tracker reference into the intake.

### Tracker-first (Azure / Jira stories)

```bash
squad new-story <feature> --id <tracker-id>          # fetch intake from tracker
# → edit .squad/stories/<feature>/<id>/intake.md
/squad-plan-generate .squad/stories/<feature>/<id>/intake.md
/squad-implement .squad/plans/<feature>/NN-story-<id>.md
```

### Story id convention

| Folder name | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `6521/` | Came from Azure DevOps (bare numeric id) |
| `q-stats-filter/` | Local quick story, no tracker yet |

Azure-sourced and quick stories never collide — the `q-` prefix is the visual separator.

## Quickstart

```bash
cd your-project
squad init --agents claude-code                        # bootstrap .squad/ and install slash commands
squad new-story auth --title "SSO support"             # tracker-first: or --id ENG-42 to auto-fetch
# → edit .squad/stories/auth/ENG-42/intake.md

/squad-plan-generate .squad/stories/auth/ENG-42/intake.md   # in Claude Code
# → .squad/plans/auth/01-story-sso-support.md

# new Claude Code session · attach ONLY the plan file
/squad-implement .squad/plans/auth/01-story-sso-support.md
```

Or skip the tracker entirely with local-first:

```
/squad-quick "add SSO support to the auth module"
```

Configuration, credential edits, and non-interactive flags: see [`docs/customization.md`](docs/customization.md) and `squad config show`. Full walkthrough: [`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md).

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `squad init` | Scaffold `.squad/` with config, bundled prompts reference, and agent slash-commands. See [`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md). |
| `squad new-story [feature] [--id ID] [--title …] [--no-tracker] [--no-fetch] [--no-attachments] [--attachment-mb n]` | Create a story intake. Auto-fetches from the configured tracker when `--id` is given. |
| `squad quick-story --feature <slug> [--title …] [--json]` | Create a local quick-story intake (no tracker). Id prefixed with `q-`. Use `/squad-quick` for the full analyze+plan flow. |
| `squad new-plan [intake] [--copy] [--feature <slug>] [--all]` | Compose the plan prompt and copy to clipboard. Use `/squad-plan-generate` inside Claude Code for direct generation (no API key needed). |
| `squad push-work-item --kind <kind> --title <title> [--description …] [--acceptance …] [--parent <id>] [--tags …] [--json]` | Create a work item on Azure DevOps. Requires PAT with "Work Items (Read & Write)" scope. Use `/squad-log` for the full summarize+create flow. |
| `squad status` | Counts, next `NN`, planner and tracker rows (including credential source). |
| `squad list [--feature <slug>]` | Table of stories and plan state. |
| `squad tracker link [story] [id]` | Attach or update a tracker id on an intake. |
| `squad config <show\|set\|unset\|remove-credential> …` | View and edit `.squad/config.yaml` and `.squad/secrets.yaml` interactively. See [`docs/customization.md`](docs/customization.md). |
| `squad rm <story\|plan\|feature> [target] [--dry-run] [--trash] [-y]` | Safely delete with cascading overview updates. |
| `squad doctor [--fix] [--json]` | Full health check; `--fix` applies non-destructive repairs. |
| `squad migrate [--dry-run] [-y]` | One-shot 0.1.x → 0.2.0 structural migrations. Destructive. |
| `squad upgrade [--check] [-y]` | Check npm and install a newer squad-kit release. |
| `squad console [--port n] [--no-open]` | Start the loopback web console; see [`docs/console.md`](docs/console.md). |

**Slash commands (Claude Code):**

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/squad-quick "<raw description>"` | Analyze codebase, create local intake, generate plan — no tracker. |
| `/squad-plan-generate <intake-path>` | Generate an implementation plan from any intake (tracker or quick). |
| `/squad-implement <plan-path>` | Execute a plan in a fresh Claude Code session. |
| `/squad-log --kind <kind> [--parent <id>] <q-id>` | Document a completed quick story on Azure DevOps (no re-analysis). |

Deeper option lists: `squad <command> --help` and the `docs/` pages above.

## Plan generation

This fork removes the direct API planner (`squad new-plan --api`). Use `/squad-plan-generate` inside Claude Code instead — it runs the same planning logic using your Claude Code session, with no API key required.

```
/squad-plan-generate .squad/stories/<feature>/<id>/intake.md
```

Once the plan is written, open a new Claude Code session and implement it:

```
/squad-implement .squad/plans/<feature>/NN-story-<id>.md
```

For copy-paste mode (paste into any chat), use `squad new-plan --copy`. The `/squad-plan` command (original squad-kit slash command) continues to work unchanged for agents with access to the squad-kit prompt templates.

## Tracker auto-fetch

`squad new-story <feature> --id <ID>` pulls the work item's title, description, labels, and attachments (≤ 10 MB each) straight into the intake. Supported trackers in 0.2.0: **Jira Cloud**, **Azure DevOps Services**.

Credentials follow the same resolution order as the planner (env → `.squad/secrets.yaml` → prompt → fail). `squad init` prompts for them when a supported tracker is selected.

Flags:

- `--no-fetch` — scaffold an empty intake; never call the tracker.
- `--no-attachments` — fetch metadata only.
- `--attachment-mb <n>` — override the 10 MB per-file cap.
- `--no-tracker` — skip the tracker id requirement for this story even when `naming.includeTrackerId: true`.

Full example with Azure DevOps: [`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md).

## Secrets

squad-kit stores settings in two files:

| File | Purpose | Git-tracked? | Editable by hand? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.squad/config.yaml` | Project name, tracker, naming, agents, planner shape. | yes — commit it | yes, but `squad config set` is safer |
| `.squad/secrets.yaml` | Planner + tracker API tokens. | **no** — auto-ignored, `0600` on POSIX | no — use `squad config set` / `squad init` |

`config.yaml` rejects any key matching `apiKey`, `token`, `secret`, or `credential` at load time, so accidental commits fail loud. Rotate a credential with `squad config set planner` or `squad config set tracker`; remove one with `squad config remove-credential <section>`.

## Why not Spec-Kit?

Both aim at spec-driven development. They make different bets.

| | squad-kit | Spec-Kit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Commands | `init`, `new-story`, `new-plan`, `status`, `doctor`, `migrate`, `upgrade`, `list`, `rm`, `tracker link`, `config` | `constitution`, `specify`, `clarify`, `plan`, `tasks`, `analyze`, `checklist`, `implement` |
| `/implement` turn starts with | one plan file (~5–15 KB) | 5–7 command templates + cross-artifact reads (~15–25 KB) |
| Model-tier awareness | Built into the philosophy (planner ≠ executor) | Not prescribed |
| Generated artifacts per story | `intake.md`, `NN-story-<id>.md`, overview row | `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `research.md`, `quickstart.md`, `tasks.md` |
| Customization | Prompts ship with the CLI (fork squad-kit to change them). | Template override stack with presets/extensions |
| Runtime | Node + TypeScript, npm-distributable | Python + `uv` |
| Scope | Intentionally small | Broad, with safety nets (`clarify`, `analyze`) |

Spec-Kit ships safety rails. Squad-kit ships the cheap path and gets out of the way. Pick squad-kit when your planner already produces trustworthy plans; pick Spec-Kit when you want the process to catch planning mistakes for you.

See [`docs/philosophy.md`](docs/philosophy.md) for the token math and [`docs/vs-spec-kit.md`](docs/vs-spec-kit.md) for the full comparison.

## Tradeoffs to know

- **Quality depends on the planning model.** squad-kit has no safety-net commands. Use a strong model for `new-plan`.
- **Plans are project-coupled.** They reference real file paths. That is the point — do not expect portability between projects.
- **Global `NN` can collide on parallel branches.** Rebase-and-renumber is the resolution. Documented in [`docs/customization.md`](docs/customization.md).
- **Anthropic Tier 1 + Opus** shares a tight input-token-per-minute bucket. **0.3.0** added prompt caching (on by default) so typical multi-turn plans stay viable; see [Prompt caching](docs/customization.md#prompt-caching) in the customization docs.

## Non-goals for 0.2

We ship lean on purpose. Current non-goals:

- OpenAI-compatible generic endpoint (local models, OpenRouter, etc.); [Direct planner (optional)](#direct-planner-optional) covers hosted Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google
- MCP server
- `squad implement` (future release)
- `/clarify`, `/analyze`, constitution-equivalent
- Telemetry
